## Introduction ##
This is the a very basic buildout template to run varnish.

## I am feeling lucky! ##
Lucky people read the documentation,
anyway if you have a local copy of this buildout,
try to run this command:
```bash
make
```
## For the impatients ##
To start the buildout:
```bash
python2.7 bootstrap.py &&  ./bin/buildout
```
To launch varnish:
```bash
./bin/varnish
```

## Requirements ##
You may want to install this to get this buildout working:
```bash
# python stuff
apt-get install python-dev python-virtualenv
# other stuff
apt-get install libpcre++-dev libreadline-dev
```

## How to modify this buildout ##
The varnish template for the configuration 
is in `templates/varnish.vcl.in`.
This template is inspired by 
http://developer.plone.org/hosting/varnish.html#id12.
The buildout will compile this file and create a file in `etc/varnish.vcl`.
